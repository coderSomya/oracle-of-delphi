## Die Hard

MS Dhoni rolls three fair standard six-sided dice. Then he looks at all the rolls and chooses a subset of the dice (possibly empty, possibly all three) to reroll. After rerolling, he wins if and only if the sum of the numbers face up on the three dice is exactly `7`. MSD always plays to optimize his chances of winning. What is the probability that he chooses to reroll exactly 2 of the dice?
