You are in a corridor with 100 doors, all of which are initially closed. You make 100 passes through the corridor. During each pass, you toggle the state (open/close) of the doors as follows:

On the 1st pass, you toggle every door (i.e., you open all doors since they were initially closed).
On the 2nd pass, you toggle every 2nd door (i.e., doors 2, 4, 6, ...).
On the 3rd pass, you toggle every 3rd door (i.e., doors 3, 6, 9, ...).
This process continues for 100 passes, with the 

_i-th_ pass toggling every  _i-th_ door.
At the end of the 100th pass, determine:

How many doors are open?
Which doors are open.

Bonus : solve it for any number of doors n.
