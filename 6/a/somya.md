## Answer
We can never reach (2,3)

## Solution

Usually, when you want to compute f(f(f(....f(something)))), its a good idea to see whats `invariant` in successive iterations.

For our question -> 
f(a,b) turns into f(a+x/b, b+x/a)

basically, f(a,b) -> f((ax+b)/b, (ax+b)/a)

so the ratio of arguments are same `(a/b)`

so we will only reach to such coordinates such that `x/y = 1/2`

Hence, we will never reach 2/3
