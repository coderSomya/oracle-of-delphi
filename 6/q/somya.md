Premise:

Let `G` be an infinitely large square grid. A point (a,b) on `G` is one which is `a` units horizontal and `b` units vertical from the starting vertex (0,0). A jump `J(x)` is defined such that on performing the jump, you move from (a,
b) to (a+x/b, b+x/a) where `x` is a real positive number.

Question:

If you somehow are at (1,2) currently, can u move to the position (2,3) after performing finite number of jumps `J`?
If yes, what is the minimum number of such jumps?
